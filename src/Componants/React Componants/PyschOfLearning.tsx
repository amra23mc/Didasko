              I remember moving back to India after living in the United States,
              and not being able to communicate with the people in my
              neighborhood. I yearned to play cricket with the kids on my block,
              but could never find a way to connect with them. The language
              barrier between us was more than just a mental construct- it was a
              social one too. To this day, I wonder how different it would be if
              I just knew my local language from the start. Maybe I'd have some
              great friends I could chuck a ball around with.

              To this end, our goal at Didask≈ç is to ensure that everyone gets a
              say in their stories. To ensure no voice is left unheard. To
              ensure no soul feels left out. Our passion applies to all ages,
              from the youth to the elderly. This hits especially home, since
              both my grandmothers lived their whole lives with the desire to
              learn English, amplified especially after their temporary move to
              the USA, where they found it especially difficult to connect with
              people.
